# SQL-Data-Analysis-Project

# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing product returns using SQL queries to gather meaningful data for a product manager. The goal of the analysis is to provide insights into the frequency and percentage of product returns by state and product type. The SQL commands are designed to capture data from a preloaded database and present clear findings, helping stakeholders make informed decisions regarding product improvements and sales strategies.

# Features
The project analyzes the number of returns by state and identifies the products with the highest return frequency. Using SQL queries, it also calculates the percentage of returns by product type. These insights allow the product manager to understand return patterns and address potential product issues. The findings show that Massachusetts, Arkansas, and West Virginia have the highest return frequencies, with specific products like the BAS-48-1C and ENT-48-40F being returned the most.

# Files
The project includes SQL queries to gather data on product returns and a report summarizing the analysis for stakeholders. Screenshots of the query results are also provided to illustrate the outcomes of the data analysis.
